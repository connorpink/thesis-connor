\chapter{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}
After presenting your idea, you now have to devise a way of convincing the reader why your idea is great.
You can do this by proving the correctness of your algorithm, proving the soundness of your type system, a proof-of-concept compiler or a benchmark of your implementation compared against pre-existing solutions.
This of course depends on your research field and your approach for answering your research question.
When conducting experiments and studies, be sure to explain your methodology and hypotheses before showing the results.
