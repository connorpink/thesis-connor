\chapter{Overview}\label{ch:overview}
Introduces the terminology, definitions and concepts you use in the rest of your paper here.
You should mention every non-trivial piece of information here. 
I can be difficult to decide what to consider as trivial and non-trivial.
Including too much trivial information may be seen as boring and condescending by the readers.
Yet, including too little non-trivial information might be considered as a lack of understanding your research topic and area.
Thus, as a rule of thumb, regard the reader as well-versed in your research area such that the basics of your field (i.e. concepts you learned in compulsory lectures) do not need to be reiterated.
Everything beyond that can be seen as non-trivial.
