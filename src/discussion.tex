\chapter{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
The discussion critically evaluates your idea and evaluation.
Try to think like an adversary and come up with scenarios that might break your approach.
It might seem counterproductive to criticise your own work.
However, every flaw you find, your reviewer might find as well.
Thus, this chapter allows you to directly address these concerns and, in the best case, dispel any doubts.
But of course, every work has limitations and edge cases.
Acknowledging these weaknesses and arguing why they do not matter or how they might be solved by extending your work will be a testament to your scientific abilities.
