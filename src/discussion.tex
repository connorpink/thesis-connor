\chapter{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
A discussion is not an ex- planation of your results – this should be part of your evaluation. Instead, a discussion critically evaluates your approach and evaluation. Most things we do in computer science are not perfect: There will be edge cases, limitations, or scenarios where other approaches are better. This section is your opportu- nity to acknowledge the weaknesses of your thesis and discuss why or why not they matter (and how they could be addressed by someone else extending your approach).
You might be asking yourself: “Why would I talk about things that do not work?!” Because if you do not, your examiner will. You have a unique opportunity to anticipate the comments that your examiner (or a peer reviewer in case of a research paper) might make about your approach. This shows that you are fully aware of these limitations and edge cases, and it lets you weaken the impact of those kinds of comments. Being able to look at your own work critically is also a testament to your scientific abilities. Remember that the goal of research is not to sell something but to advance your field of research.
