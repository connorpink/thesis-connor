\chapter{Related Work}
In this chapter, you present and discuss other work in your research area.
The goal is to compare and relate your idea and results to other research.
Of course, the goal is not to discredit other papers to elevate your own, but rather showcase similarities and differences.
For example, presenting related work that came to similar results may be seen as evidence for the credibility of your own results.
Outlining differences and improvements compared to previously presented solutions can help to further elevate your work.

Sometimes this section is also incorporated into the overview, but it can be tedious for the reader to work through related work before actually having seen your idea.
Putting this chapter at the end has the added advantage that the reader is already familiar with your work and can more easily follow along when comparing it to other work.
