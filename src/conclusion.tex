\chapter{Conclusion}
Finally, it is time to conclude your thesis.
Here, give a brief overview of everything you have done.
Some research papers also use this to provide an outlook on future work you plan to do â€“ in most cases, students do not continue to work on their thesis projects, though (it might still be interesting to hear your thoughts on this if you have some ideas which are not implementation details/features).
